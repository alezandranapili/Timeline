Instead of relying on hand-coded linguistic rules, NETtalk used a neural network trained with backpropagation to map sequences of letters into phonemes. Over time, the system moved from “babbling” outputs to producing intelligible speech, showing that connectionist models could learn the complex rules and exceptions of English pronunciation from examples. This was one of the earliest demonstrations that neural networks could generalize to novel words, resist damage gracefully, and capture linguistic regularities in a biologically inspired way—laying important groundwork for modern speech recognition and natural language processing systems.</p>"
